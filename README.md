# ipe.py: Instagram Picture Extractor
Extracts images from Instagram posts. Downloads the images to the directory that the script is running from so keep that in mind. Also for some reason Instagram likes to have 3 copies of each image in varying resolutions which is why there are seemingly 3 copies of each.
# Usage
Pretty simple: `python ipe.py https://www.instagram.com/p/BusBK6ahZ5Z/`
